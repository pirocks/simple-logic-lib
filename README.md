# simple-logic-lib
A simple logic library. Currently a work in progress. Jars on Maven central should be working/useable.

Current features include:
- A library for manipulating first order logic expressions. 
- Outputting to mathml/html
- Outputing to prefix notation/easily parseable string form
- Performing fairly simple pattern matching and pattern based rewriting. 
- Equals/hashcode implementation which handles bound variables correctly.
- Natural deduction proof verification.
- Kotlin DSL builder syntax for natural deduction proofs. 
- Infix builder functions for logic
